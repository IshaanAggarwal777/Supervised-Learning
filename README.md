045021_Supervised Learning

In this project we used Hotel Customer details that we have segmented using K-means Machine Learning clustering algorithm and applied variou supervised learning learning algorithms to classify the features in the data and find the optimal algorithm and its important features. Also, provided insights on how hotels can use tailored strategies for different classes.

hotel data csv.csv: Dataset (Kaggle) containing cluster number. 045021_Cross-Validation: Contains the executable code as well as the Report of the Classification.
